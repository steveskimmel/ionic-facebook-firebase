This is an Ionic project that is integrated with my Firebase account as well as my Facebook app. It makes use of native Facebook Oauth authentication and then implements the Firebase signInWithCredential function to authenticate a Facebook user with Firebase. This provides a nifty workaround for the current issues that you will face when trying to authenticate using the signInWithPopup or signInWithRedirect functions. It then includes some other nifty Ionic functionality with regard to uploading/viewing images to/from Firebase.
